## What It Is

The Outside Inn is a virtual destination where *"Outsiders are welcomed to step Innside, and stay."* It's a streaming brand, a 24/7 lofi radio station, and a growing community of "Innsiders" rewarded for early patronage.

The brand lives on the threshold between polarities—where home meets destination, where history meets fantasy, where day meets dusk. The Inn is the space between.

## Brand Philosophy: The Threshold Between

The Outside Inn is built on the concept of boundaries and the space between them. Every element of the brand explores this liminal quality:

| Inside | Outside | **Between** |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Home | Destination | **Inn** |
| Indoors | Outdoors | **Window** |
| Artifact | Machine | **Artifice** |
| History | Fantasy | **Myth** |
| Mortal | Divine | **Legend** |
| Day | Night | **Dusk** |
| Night | Day | **Dawn** |
| Past | Present | **Memory** |
| Present | Future | **Dream** |
| Civilization | Wilderness | **Gate** |
| Welcome | Unwelcome | **Invitation** |
| Joy | Danger | **Precipice** |

*The "Between" column is where we live.*
