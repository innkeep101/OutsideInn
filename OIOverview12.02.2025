## What It Is

The Outside Inn is a virtual destination where *"Outsiders are welcomed to step Innside, and stay."* It's a 24/7 lofi radio station, a streaming brand, and a growing community of "Innsiders" rewarded for early patronage.

The brand lives on the threshold between polarities—where home meets destination, where history meets fantasy, where day meets dusk. The Inn is the space between.

## Brand Philosophy: The Threshold Between

The Outside Inn is built on the concept of boundaries and the space between them. Every element of the brand explores this liminal quality:

| Inside | Outside | **Between** |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Home | Destination | **Inn** |
| Indoors | Outdoors | **Window** |
| Artifact | Machine | **Artifice** |
| History | Fantasy | **Myth** |
| Mortal | Divine | **Legend** |
| Day | Night | **Dusk** |
| Night | Day | **Dawn** |
| Past | Present | **Memory** |
| Present | Future | **Dream** |
| Civilization | Wilderness | **Gate** |
| Welcome | Unwelcome | **Invitation** |
| Joy | Danger | **Precipice** |

*The "Between" column is where we live.*

## Workstreams

### Innspired LoFi — 24/7 Radio Station

A continuous lofi fantasy radio stream broadcast across all major platforms. Carson's original music loops over Marwan's animation of Holdt—a steampunk Holden Caulfield writing with contented focus. The radio runs 24/7 and never stops. This is the default state of the Inn.

### E.I. Werner Live at the Inn

When E.I. Werner goes live, the Outside Inn hosts his stream. Carson's music continues at 50% volume behind gameplay. Audiences mix—radio listeners discover the host, gaming viewers discover the Inn. The Inn is always open; sometimes the innkeeper is there.

Content includes:

- Strategy games (Anno, Civilization series)
- Variety gaming
- **World of Warcraft lore series** — A custom narrative tying the Outside Inn to WoW's Goldshire history, featuring Deadkeep (a Dark Iron Dwarf Death Knight) uncovering the lost history of the original Outside Inn through the Archaeology profession

### Material Products

Collectible physical goods including posters, coasters, stickers, and vinyl records. Both stock inventory (print-on-demand) and limited-edition signed variants (1,296 numbered copies).

### Digital Products

NFT packages minted on the blockchain, including numbered loyalty badges for early Patrons and collectible art tied to album tracks. NFTs unlock exclusive online and in-person rewards.

### Community — The Innsiders

A community of supporters built through Patreon and Discord:

## How Broadcast Works

The Outside Inn operates a single 24/7 broadcast with two modes:

| Mode | What's Happening | Music |
|------|------------------|-------|
| **Radio Mode** | Holdt writing, no host | 100% volume |
| **Live Mode** | E.I. Werner streaming, hosted by the Inn | 50% background |

The Inn is always open. The innkeeper comes and goes. The music never stops.
