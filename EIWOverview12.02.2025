# E.I. Werner

**Brand & Streaming Strategy** | Last Updated: December 2, 2025

> ⚠️ **CONFIDENTIAL** — Not to be distributed without authorization

## Who He Is

E.I. Werner is an aspiring fantasy author from New York. High-brow tastes, true geek at heart. Confident but not arrived. Warm but not over-eager. The guy who knows things—about lore, about myth, about what makes stories work—and wants to share the journey.

**The energy:** Brimming with potential. Early days. A shepherd, not a performer. Someone building something real in public.

**The role:** The Innkeeper. Welcomes you in, takes you places—Outside Inn, ancient Athens, Azeroth, wherever. You're an Innsider now.

**The voice:** Friendly, charismatic, occasionally in-character. Never corny. Never political. Never in day-to-day culture wars. Says *"take you there"* and means it.

**The author identity:** Subtext, not headline—but he's clear about his dreams. It's scary to say, but it's true. People who follow E.I. Werner are watching someone become the thing he's always known he would be.

## Relationship to Outside Inn

E.I. Werner is the **person**. Outside Inn is the **place**.

| Element | E.I. Werner | Outside Inn |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **What it is** | The innkeeper | The inn |
| **Visual style** | Monochrome (black/white/grey) | Color (warm, inviting) |
| **Presence** | Live when streaming | 24/7, always open |
| **Role** | Flagship host, founder | The destination |

The Outside Inn exists whether E.I. Werner is there or not. But when he's there, he's the host welcoming you in.

## How It Works: The Hybrid Model

**The Outside Inn 24/7 radio never stops.** When E.I. Werner goes live, the Inn *hosts* his stream. The music continues at reduced volume. Audiences mix.

| State | What's Happening | Music |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| **Radio Mode** | Holdt writing, no host | 100% volume |
| **E.I. Werner Live** | Gaming stream hosted by Outside Inn | 50% background |

**The viewer experience:**
- Someone discovers Outside Inn for the lofi
- E.I. Werner goes live—they see him at the Inn
- They become a fan of both
- When the stream ends, the radio continues

**The key insight:** You're not "going live" and "going offline." You're arriving at the Inn and departing. The Inn is always open.

## Strategic Benefits

### 1. Stream Whenever You Want
You love gaming. This lets you do it publicly, on your schedule, with no 24/7 pressure. That's the Inn's job.

### 2. Testing Ground
Every overlay, alert sound, emote, and channel point redemption—test it during E.I. Werner streams first. Work out the kinks before Outside Inn's full launch.

### 3. Content Engine
Streams generate clips. Clips feed X, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts. You're marketing Outside Inn before it even launches—just by being yourself.

### 4. Audience Funnel
People follow people, not projects. They discover E.I. Werner → watch the stream → get exposed to Outside Inn → become Innsiders. You're the front door.

### 5. The WoW Lore Series Is the Bridge
The Deadkeep series—uncovering the lost history of the Outside Inn through WoW's Archaeology profession—is E.I. Werner content that *literally* tells the Outside Inn origin story. Marketing disguised as gameplay.

### 6. Mixed Audiences Compound
Outside Inn radio viewers see you when you go live. Your gaming viewers get exposed to the Inn and Carson's music. Both audiences grow together.

## Visual & Audio Specs

### Visual Language

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| **Palette** | Black, white, grey only (monochrome) |
| **Style** | Pixel art, Game Boy Color era, fantasy-inflected |
| **Font** | Alagard |
| **Feel** | Simple. Comfortable. Not overdesigned. |

The monochrome E.I. Werner aesthetic is the stripped-down sibling of Outside Inn's warmer, colorful world. Same soul, different threshold.

### Audio

| Context | Music |
|---------|-------|
| Outside Inn 24/7 radio | Carson's loop at 100% |
| E.I. Werner live at the Inn | Carson's loop at 50% behind gameplay |

The music is the constant. It bridges radio mode and live mode. Viewers always know they're at the Inn.

## The Community

**Followers are called:** Innsiders

**Catchphrase:** *"Take you there"*

Whether they find E.I. Werner through gaming or Outside Inn through the radio, they end up in the same place. The Inn welcomes all outsiders.

---

## Future Vision

The Outside Inn is designed to become more than one person's stream. Eventually, the 24/7 channel could host other creators—guest streamers who fit the vibe, taking scheduled slots at the Inn while the radio plays behind them. Programming blocks. Partnerships. A media destination, not just a lofi stream.

E.I. Werner will always be the founder and flagship host. But the Inn is bigger than one innkeeper.

That's Year 2. For now: build the foundation, grow the audience, prove the model.
