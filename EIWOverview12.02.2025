## The One-Liner

*"I want to know I went the distance."*

## The Family

### Parents

Father is a Harvard-educated doctor who didn't grow up rich but made it later. The family has more money than Evan probably knows. Both parents are supportive when he has a prestigious tech job; they constantly need his confidence to reassure them. He performs certainty so they can sleep at night.

### The Brothers

**Zack (38 in January)** — Oldest. Finance, co-founder of Function Health. Does ayahuasca now. History of physically abusing Evan as children; was sent to boarding school. The relationship is fraught, built on years of violence and tension, but they try.

**Adam (36)** — Two years older than Evan. Gay. The brother Evan is closest to. Knows everything.

**Matt (youngest)** — More like the parents. Loves the Yankees. Has a wife and the only grandchild. The traditional path.

**Evan** — The artist. The one who's been saying he'll be a fantasy author since age 15. The one who doesn't respond to texts.

## The E.I. Werner Project

### Origin

At 15, Evan decided he would be a fantasy author. Not "wanted to be" — *decided*. That decision has organized everything since: the walls around his emotions, the shallow relationships, the weekends alone, the career moves that fund the art. E.I. Werner isn't a pen name. It's the version of himself that could matter.

### The Mission

*"I want people to feel that magic is here and it's possible and it's us. We can make it. I want to help people see the timeless truths beneath the blowing winds of culture wars."*

### The Work

**Only Us** — A fantasy trilogy. The primary book project. *Only Us* imagines Joseph (yes, from Genesis) as Zoh Orr, a king's favorite daughter who ascends even after her envious sisters poison the king and kingdom against her. While writing as Zoh, I wonder the same questions everyone, since forever, has wondered: Who am I? Why am I here? What was before here? What was before that? Why so much suffering? Does any of it matter?

But Zoh and I don't have the Bible, Big Bang, or Bill of Rights. We have ONCE, 6 myths:

1. **MOTHER** — Origin of the cosmos
2. **BROTHER** — Origin of "Good" and "Evil"
3. **WAR** — Evolution of humans
4. **GATE** — Origin of society
5. **CHOSEN** — Origin of authority
6. **CREED** — Origin of law

**The Marathon Script** — A movie script co-written with Otis Blum (Jason Blum's half-brother). About the world's first marathon runner in ancient Athens and the birth of imperfect democracy. The script got hot. Evan's work on the project will be complete and ready to send by January 20, 2026.

**Outside Inn** — A streaming/lofi/community project. A tavern where "Outsiders are welcomed to step Innside, and stay." The community is called "Innsiders" with "take you there" as the core catchphrase. Team: Carson Thatcher (music), Marwan Hasnaoui (animation).

**E.I. Werner Streaming** — Gaming and lore content. A hybrid model where gaming streams happen over Outside Inn's background music at reduced volume. Archives on YouTube.

**Analog Writing Course** — Currently preparing for an analog writing course focused on delivering a project in one year with built-in accountability. Will be working on ONCE.

**Kept** — First installment of an earlier fantasy trilogy. Written. Had an agent. Retired after being rejected by all major fantasy publishers.

**Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall** — Wrote quests for this tabletop game at Incredible Dream Studios. Kickstarter funded in three hours, raised $312k, shipped to acclaim (8.4/10 BoardGameGeek). Characters he created remain core after 2 reprintings and 2 expansions.

### The Cost

What has been sacrificed for the project: Being part of a community. Being like other people. All his weekends. Being satisfied with the present. The sensitive person beneath the walls, who has been deemed less important than E.I. Werner.

## The Inner Architecture

### The Walls

*"I'm sensitive but I've built walls and walls around my emotions — they distract from the E.I. Werner project. I've committed my life to this, sacrificed everything I can."*

There is a person beneath. But E.I. Werner feels more powerful and important than him. The man and the mission have fused. He's wondered if he's a narcissist, but decides he has too much empathy and sensitivity for others for that to be true.

### The Duty Framework

*"I feel like everyone on earth would love the cards I got. Loving parents, rich family, interesting brothers, 6 feet tall, white, charismatic, every tutor, best education. I have to play my cards to the best of my ability. I feel a duty to that and that which is in my chest."*

The privilege isn't a gift to enjoy — it's an obligation to repay by becoming something extraordinary. Most people with his hand would coast. He can't. The cards themselves are the weight.

### The Sequencing

He wants the white picket fence — a wife, kids, a study full of books he wrote, a legacy. But first, he must *arrive*. The people he admires never gave up and made it. He's that. He knows it. The reward comes after the world sees what he sees.

### On Giving Up

*"Never. For real, I'd rather die."*

This isn't crisis language. This is stakes language. E.I. Werner isn't a career goal. It's the reason he exists. Failure isn't an option because failure means he was wrong about himself his whole life.

## The Presentation

6'0". Handsome. Self-described as looking like "Jon Snow x Bradley Cooper, for real." Gets laid easily. A great rebound. Doesn't date seriously — intimacy is a threat to the project, so he keeps things shallow.

Was student body president. Captain of every team. Very charismatic. Can quote Bible and literature verses off the dome. Gets animated and passionate when he speaks. Knows he'd make a terrifying cult leader.

Self-described as "quirky." Never responds to texts.

Has struggled with daily weed use.

## The Career (For Now)

**SKIMS (2022–2025)** — Product Manager, Internal Tools. Founded and led a pod (3 engineers). Built Apollo, Lighthouse, Watchtower. Integrated 14 APIs.

**Siberia Studio (2021–2022)** — Senior TPM. Orchestrated the YEEZY x Adidas x Gap drop app. 6 million queries/minute under bot attack.

**Incredible Dream (2020–2021)** — Writer/PM for Kinfire Chronicles.

**Portal (2016–2020)** — Co-founder, CPO. Social video platform. 43k concurrent users, $812k in user transactions.

Looking for the easiest possible remote job in ecommerce tech to fund the art. The job is a tool, not a career.

## What Success Looks Like

A study in the dopest pad. A wife and kids. A legacy of beautiful books. Being able to send someone a book and say: I wrote this. You can read it.

Not fame. Not money. *Legitimacy* — the right to call himself what he's known he is since he was 15.

And once that's secured, Evan gets to come back. The sensitive one. The one who wants kids. He's just waiting for E.I. Werner to finish the job first.

*"I'd rather die than live a suburban normal life. Not because I don't think it's beautiful — but because I know that isn't what I was put here to do. But I also don't mind working. I like the work."*
