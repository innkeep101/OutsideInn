# Brand: The Threshold Between Polarity

The Outside Inn is built on the concept of boundaries and the space between them.

Found it! Here's a summary for an AI not focused on WoW:

## The Outside Inn × World of Warcraft Connection

**Custom Lore:** The Outside Inn is the fictional precursor to Goldshire's inn (a famous location in WoW). In your lore:

- **Thoradin** (a legendary WoW king) landed in Elwynn Forest when it was wild and spider-infested—not yet safe farmland
- He founded **The Outside Inn** on the threshold between civilization and wilderness
- The inn *created* safety—Elwynn became farmland *because* of the Outside Inn's protection
- It was given to two brothers: **Innkept** (human priest, welcomes people in) and **Outkeep** (worgen rogue, keeps threats out)
- The inn was eventually destroyed, allies slain, and **Goldshire was built on its grave**—the land forgot what it owed

**The Streaming Series:**
- You play **Deadkeep**, a Dark Iron Dwarf Death Knight raised so many times he's stoic and cold, with no memory of his past
- Through the **Archaeology profession**, you'll uncover the lost history of the Outside Inn
- Each discovery gives narrative reason to "raise" a fallen ally (your other characters) one at a time
- This creates a structured unlock system tying gameplay to lore
- This can be started earlier for content on the EIW backup stream

**The Roster:** All your characters are "-keep" themed (Gearkeep, Thornkeep, Zookeep, etc.), each with distinct personalities and roles at the original Outside Inn.
