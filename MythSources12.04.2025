The rhetorical question was designed to appeal to the conscience of 18th-century society by emphasizing the shared humanity between enslaved people and free citizens, becoming a powerful symbol of the abolitionist movement.                                                | 1787 CE               |

This innocent question immediately establishes the central conflict and foreshadows the story's themes of life, death, and compassion as Fern rushes to save the runt piglet Wilbur.                                                                                                | 1952 CE               |

Often associated with George Berkeley's idealism, it questions whether unobserved phenomena can be said to exist, challenging our assumptions about the nature of reality, consciousness, and the role of observation in determining existence.                                                            | c. 1700 CE            |

It presents a classic example of circular causality where each element in the cycle appears to require the other for its existence, highlighting the difficulty of identifying true beginnings in cyclical processes.                                                      | c. 350 BCE            |

The question encourages individuals to consider moral choices by imagining how Jesus Christ would act in their situation, making it a practical tool for Christian ethical decision-making.                                                                                   | 1896 CE               |

The rhetorical question envisions a dark, prophetic birth in Bethlehem - a twisted inversion of Christ's nativity - suggesting that civilization's collapse will give birth to something monstrous rather than redemptive.                                                                  | 1919 CE               |

The rhetorical question addresses themes of human dignity, freedom, and social justice. Dylan suggests that the answers to such profound questions about humanity and justice are elusive, 'blowin' in the wind' just out of reach.                                                                    | 1963 CE               |

The choice of this biblical quote for the inaugural long-distance communication marked the dawn of the modern telecommunications era with a sense of divine wonder.                               | c. 1400 BCE / 1844 CE |

The paradox asks how an omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent God can coexist with the existence of evil and suffering in the world, forcing believers to reconcile divine goodness with worldly suffering.                                  | c. 300 BCE            |

Its enduring popularity comes from the anticlimax, as it subverts expectations of a clever punchline with a simple truism. The riddle has become a cultural touchstone for anti-humor and the unexpected profundity of simple truths.                                                                                      | c. 1840 CE            |

If God can create such a stone, then there's something He cannot do (lift it). If He cannot create such a stone, then there's also something He cannot do (create it). The paradox highlights fundamental logical problems in defining unlimited power.                                                            | c. 1200 CE            |
