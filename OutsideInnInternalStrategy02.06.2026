# Outside Inn — Internal Strategy Doc
**Last updated: February 6, 2026**
**Audience: EIW + AI planning sessions**

---

## What This Is

Outside Inn is a 24/7 LoFi fantasy radio station. Original music plays over a looping pixel art animation of Holdt — a steampunk Holden Caulfield — writing at a desk inside a stone inn. The tagline is "Step inn anytime and stay."

The station runs on rails. No interruptions, no talking head, no schedule. Someone leaves it on for a 6-hour work session, comes back tomorrow, does it again. Reliability is the product.

E.I. Werner is a completely separate channel — gaming, writing, personal content. The brands share a world and an audience pipeline, but never the same stream.

## Brand

Outside Inn is the place between places. The threshold.

| Inside | Outside | Outside Inn |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Home | Destination | Inn |
| Welcome | Unwelcome | Invitation |
| Locked | Unlocked | Key |
| Day | Night | Dusk |
| Night | Day | Dawn |

## Team

| Name | Role | Rate | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|
| E.I. Werner | Innkeep / Founder | — | Active |
| Carson Thatcher | Chordkeep / Composer | $300/month base + $3k album | **Deal closed** |
| Marwan Hasnaoui | Illustrator / Animator | ~$300/month | Active — deadline Feb 21 |

### Carson Deal (Resolved)
- **Album payment:** $3,000 total (well under the $5,600 ceiling)
- **Ownership:** 50/50 masters, 50/50 publishing
- **Ongoing:** $300/month base, 3 tracks/month minimum
- **Phase 2 (at 50 patrons):** 10% Patreon revenue, 50% sync licensing
- **Always:** 50% streaming royalties, 1 Innkeep Edition NFT per album

**Key clarification:** The loop and album are one body of work. The loop is the continuous 99-minute mix; the album is the best tracks pulled out of it. Same music, two formats. 65 minutes already exist — Carson is finishing ~34 more minutes, not starting from scratch.

## Products (via Fourthwall)

### Phase 1 — March 3 Launch
| Product | Base Cost | Price | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Desk Mat 15.5"×31.5" | $13.00 | TBD (base-7) | Hero product |

| Classic Mousepad 8.7"×7.1" | $9.13 | TBD (base-7) | Entry-level |

**No wordmarks on products.** Let the art be art. A desk mat is something someone looks at for hours — a wordmark stamped on it turns art into merch. Premium positioning means the product doesn't need to label itself.

**Pricing:** Base-7 themed ($7.77, $14.14, $21.21, $28.28, $35.35, $42.42, $49.49).

## Brand Principles

**The Outside Inn is a place, not a person's YouTube page.** The stream should feel like it just exists. No talking head, no interruptions, no creator personality on the channel. Reliability is the product.

**Separate from E.I. Werner completely.** The machinima about the Outside Inn? Releases on EIW. Process content? EIW. Anything with a human face or voice? EIW. The radio station never breaks character.

**Cross-pollination happens through EIW, not through the station.** Mention Outside Inn on the gaming stream. Link it in bios and panels. The funnel is: people discover EIW → they find the radio station → they leave it on forever.

## Fallback

If the venture isn't generating income by November 2026: remote ecommerce PM roles. SKIMS experience (Apollo, company-wide tooling adoption) plus Portal co-founder experience. Gap since June 2025 explainable as "launched creative studio and streaming brand."
