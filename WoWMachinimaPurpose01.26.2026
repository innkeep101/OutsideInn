# The Outside Inn: WoW Machinima Series

**Origin Story of the Brand Within World of Warcraft**

---

## Overview

A 5-episode narrative machinima series (~60-75 minutes total) that establishes the canonical backstory of the Outside Inn within World of Warcraft. The series transforms the brand's founding myth from marketing concept into playable lore — viewers learn why the Inn exists, then can visit the rebuilt Inn in-game through your guild and player housing.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Format | Scripted machinima with voiceover narration |
| Episodes | 5 (10-18 minutes each) |
| Total Runtime | 60-75 minutes |
| Production Method | Hybrid: DIY game capture + selective professional animation |
| Stream Integration | Capture sessions streamed live on EIW channel |

## The Story

**Present Day:** Anduin Wrynn hires Bookkeep, an expelled gnome scholar, to investigate a thousand-year gap in Stormwind's founding history. Her investigation leads her to Deadkeep, a Death Knight who has mined obsessively for centuries, haunted by a voice telling him to dig.

**The Past:** Together they uncover the truth: the original Outside Inn was destroyed when its founders accidentally released a void creature. A mother sacrificed her six children to seal it. Everyone died. No records survived. The children of Goldshire — the ones who feel "wrong" — are the seal.

**The Rebuild:** Bookkeep and Deadkeep rebuild the Inn on the original site. The ghost of Keelin Stonekeeper, Deadkeep's lost love, finally has a home again.

## Stream Integration Strategy

The machinima serves multiple purposes within the broader stream ecosystem.

### Content Pillar for EIW Gaming Stream

| Stream Type | Content | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Capture Sessions | Live game footage recording with DynamicCam/Narcissus | Weekly during production |
| Writing Sessions | Script development, lore research, worldbuilding | As needed |
| Edit Reviews | Showing rough cuts, getting chat feedback | Per episode |
| Premiere Events | Episode releases as watch parties | 5 total |

Capture sessions become content themselves. Chat helps spot good shots, suggests angles, witnesses the creative process. The audience invests in the project before they see the finished product.

### Origin Story for Guild Launch

The series ends with Bookkeep and Deadkeep stepping into an empty player house — the future Outside Inn. This directly sets up:

- **Guild: "Innsider"** — Named after your Patreon tier
- **Player Housing** — Rebuild the Outside Inn in-game, visitable by viewers
- **Community Hub** — The in-game Inn becomes a gathering place for your audience

### WoW Content Vertical

Establishes EIW as a WoW lore creator, not just a variety streamer. Opens doors to:

- Lore discussion streams
- Future machinima projects
- WoW expansion coverage
- Collaboration with WoW content creators

## Budget Tiers

| Approach | Cost | Quality Level |
|----------|------|---------------|

| Lore explainers | YouTube | Evergreen SEO content |
| Character spotlights | Instagram, Threads | Visual storytelling |

## Why This Project Matters

The Outside Inn brand currently exists as an aesthetic — cozy, liminal, inviting. The machinima transforms it into a **story**.

Viewers don't just listen to LoFi in "the Inn" — they know what the Inn is, why it was built, who died for it, and what it means to step inside. The 24/7 radio stream gains emotional weight. The gaming streams gain narrative context. The brand becomes a world, not just a vibe.

When someone asks "What is the Outside Inn?" you can point to a 75-minute film and say: *This is what it cost to build, and this is what it means to rebuild.*

---

*This project represents the largest single content investment in the EIW brand but creates the foundational narrative that makes the Outside Inn more than a stream — it makes it a place.*
