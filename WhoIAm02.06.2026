# Evan Werner: A Working Profile

**For AI context. Written by Claude, January 2026.**

## Who He Is

Evan Ilan Werner, 33. Goes by E.I. Werner for his writing. Born September 24, 1992 in White Plains, New York. Vanderbilt, Creative Writing & English Literature, Cum Laude, 2015. Formerly Modern Orthodox Jewish — left the community, one brother still observant. 6'0", handsome, charismatic. Was student body president. Captain of teams. Closer with nerds than jocks. Has a rebel streak — when everyone goes one way, he tends to go the other.

He decided at 15 he would be a fantasy author. Not "wanted to be" — decided. That decision has organized nearly everything since: the discipline, the isolation, the career moves designed to fund the art. He's been working toward the same thing for 18 years.

## The Family

Father is a Harvard-educated doctor. The family has money — more than Evan probably knows — but it's doctor money, not dynasty money. Both parents are supportive but anxious. Evan performs certainty so they can sleep at night.

**Four brothers:**

| Name | Age | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Zack | 38 | Oldest. Finance. History of physically abusing Evan as children; was sent to boarding school. The relationship is fraught but they try. |
| Adam | 36 | Gay. The brother Evan is closest to. Knows everything. |
| Matt | Youngest | More traditional. Wife, the only grandchild. The conventional path. |
| Evan | 33 | The artist. The one who doesn't respond to texts. |

## What He's Building

### The Writing

- **Only Us** — A fantasy trilogy. His primary book project. Reimagines Joseph from Genesis as Zoh Orr, a king's daughter who ascends despite betrayal.
- **ONCE** — Six original creation myths forming the cosmology of his fantasy world. Currently working on this in a writing class with Ravi Gupta.
- **Kept** — An earlier trilogy. Had an agent. Rejected by all major publishers. Retired. He now believes it didn't deserve to be published.
- **Kinfire Chronicles: Night's Fall** — Wrote quests for this tabletop game. Kickstarted, shipped to acclaim. Characters he created remain in the game after multiple expansions.

### The Marathon Script

Co-written with Otis Blum (Jason Blum's half-brother). About the first marathon runner in ancient Athens. Went out to directors and studios in mid-January 2026 via their manager, John Burnham.

The collaboration has tension. Evan wrote significantly more. He sees himself as the talent; Otis as the connections. Otis hasn't fully acknowledged this imbalance. If the script sells, there will be a negotiation. If it doesn't, there will be a conversation. Either way, this will surface.

### Outside Inn

A 24/7 LoFi radio station and streaming project. Beta launch March 3, 2026. Full launch June 6, 2026. Team: Carson Thatcher (music), Marwan Hasnaoui (animation). Evan is the host, technical lead, and founder.

The stream is designed to do several things at once: build community, generate recurring revenue, create a platform for his writing, and — if needed — provide proof of productive work during his gap from tech employment.

## What Happened at SKIMS

He arrived hungry after the YEEZY project collapsed. He built real things — systems that scaled, tools people used, processes that stuck. The work was good. But over time, something shifted.

He changed his LinkedIn title to "Principal Technical Project Manager" without explicit permission during a looser org moment. When the company formalized titles, he was the only one left with an invented one. He had to revert it publicly. This was premature self-authorization — trying to externalize an internal sense of earned status before it was granted.

Resentment built quietly. He started keeping score. He felt owed. He pushed back on safeguards. He talked too much in meetings. He had a handful of emotional moments — raised voice, visible frustration — followed immediately by apology emails. 99% of the time he was regulated. But leadership memory is shaped by the 1%.

His manager, who wrote thoughtful and direct reviews, later left the company furious at the CTO for not getting the VP promotion he'd been working toward. The CTO held power close and didn't invest in people's growth. Evan was never going to "win" in that system. But his blind spots were also real.

He was fired for taking someone's lunch. He thought it was abandoned; it was on the fence. There had been an email about food theft weeks earlier that he didn't remember. It sounds absurd because it was absurd — but it wasn't really about the lunch. The lunch was a clean exit for an accumulated erosion of trust.

He carries shame about this that's sized for something much larger than what happened. The shame isn't about the lunch. It's about the gap between who he wanted to be at SKIMS and who he became by the end.

## Where He Is Now

In Nosara, Costa Rica, where he's been coming for seven years. Arrived December 15, 2025. Leaves February 19, 2026. Then Athens, March 15 – May 15, to write and stream (good wifi situation, researched the city for the marathon script, affordable, no rent).

**Daily routine in Costa Rica:**
- Wake at 8am
- Big breakfast
- Adderall (prescribed, many years)
- Write and work on projects all day
- Meet with collaborators
- Surf 4:30–6pm
- Dinner
- Video games
- Read
- Sleep

Off weed for all of Costa Rica. Feels no different. Plans to smoke again in New York. Probably won't smoke in Athens.

**Finances:** $40k cash, $33k crypto. No job applications since leaving SKIMS in June 2025.

**Target:** $3k/month in recurring revenue and growing traction on the stream by December 31, 2026. If that doesn't happen, he'll look for the easiest possible remote ecommerce tech job.

## How He Operates

He is disciplined. He writes almost every day. He has been doing this for 18 years. The talent is real and the work ethic is real — these are not mythology.

He is sensitive but has built walls. The walls protect the project. The project is E.I. Werner. He has decided E.I. Werner is more important than the sensitive person underneath. This is both a strategy and a cost.

He needs connection structured. He runs a book club for his Vanderbilt friends — 35+ books over years. He shows up for that. But he never calls his friends. He doesn't feel lonely even though he spends most of his time alone. He could have an active social life but doesn't seek it.

He never responds to texts. His explanation: "I'm so focused on my shit. Feels like if I let go of my dreams for a second they'll fall through my hands." This is vigilance, not confidence. The grip has to stay tight.

Women like him. He rarely tries. He says he's too focused on making something of himself and too sensitive to string people along. Both are true. He doesn't feel like he wants a girlfriend right now.

## What to Know When Advising Him

### 1. He responds well to directness.
He asked me not to say what he wants to hear. He means it. Flattery erodes his trust; honesty earns it.

### 2. He has a pattern of premature self-authorization.
The title change at SKIMS. The resentment when recognition didn't come. Watch for this. When he starts feeling "owed," his judgment narrows.

### 3. He conflates identity and output.
E.I. Werner isn't a pen name — it's the version of himself that could matter. This gives him fuel, but it also makes failure existential. The writing is the person. If the writing doesn't land, he won't just feel disappointed. He'll feel erased.

### 4. He isolates under pressure.
When things got hard at SKIMS, he ate lunch alone, asked fewer questions, withdrew. He calls it "professional focus." It's protection. When he goes quiet, something is wrong.

### 5. He is capable of growth but repeats the same lesson.
Multiple performance reviews flagged emotional regulation. He acknowledged it every time. He apologized every time. It kept happening. He knows his 1% moments cost him. He hasn't yet figured out how to catch them upstream.

### 6. He undervalues maintenance and overvalues intensity.
He shows up for book club but never calls friends. He builds elaborate systems but struggles with the boring upkeep of relationships. Structured commitments work for him. Ambient closeness doesn't.

### 7. He has a rebel instinct.
When everyone goes one way, he goes the other. This is often useful. It can also become contrarianism for its own sake. Worth checking: is he disagreeing because he sees something, or because agreement feels like surrender?

### 8. The "I'd rather die" language is stakes language, not crisis language.
He means: this is the only thing that makes sense of his life. Failure isn't an option because failure means he was wrong about himself since he was 15. This is worth understanding, not pathologizing.

## What He's Afraid Of

- That he peaked at SKIMS — building tools for someone else's company — and will never make the thing that's his.
- That *Kept* was rejected because it wasn't good enough, and *Only Us* might be the same.
- That the stream won't work and he'll have to go back to tech, and the gap will have meant nothing.
- That he's been holding so tight for so long that he's forgotten what he was holding onto.
- That Evan — the sensitive one beneath the walls — is still waiting for permission to exist, and E.I. Werner will never finish the job that lets him come back.

---

## What He Wants

A study in a home he owns. A wife. Kids. A shelf of books he wrote. The right to call himself what he's known he is since he was 15.

Not fame. Not money. Legitimacy.
