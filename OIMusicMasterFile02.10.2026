## The Prompt

I'm sourcing composers for a 24/7 LoFi fantasy radio station called Outside Inn. I need to find 2-3 mid-tier freelance composers for a work-for-hire engagement where I retain full ownership of all masters and publishing. Budget is approximately $150–$250 per minute of finished music, negotiable as a project rate for a full album (14 tracks, ~99 minutes total).

**I need your help researching and identifying composers who fit my very specific niche.** This is not standard LoFi. Here's what makes it different:

### The Sound I'm Looking For

**Fantasy-adjacent productivity LoFi.** Three words that all carry equal weight:

1. **Fantasy-adjacent** — The music should feel like it could exist in a world with stone inns, candlelight, and rain on old windows. Not Celtic. Not Renaissance faire. Not video game soundtrack. Think *texture* and *warmth* — organic instruments (acoustic guitar, piano, strings, woodwinds), gentle percussion, hearth-crackle energy translated into music. The fantasy element is a feeling, not a genre.

2. **Productivity** — This is not chill-only. This is not "relax and fall asleep" music. The listener is writing, studying, coding, building something. The music should support deep focus and sustained creative work. There is forward motion here — not driving, not urgent, but present. The difference between drifting and working with quiet intensity. Think: the energy of a person writing by candlelight at 2am, not the energy of someone napping in a hammock.

3. **LoFi** — Warm, textured, imperfect. Vinyl crackle and tape hiss are welcome. Lo-fi production aesthetic applied to fantasy-adjacent instrumentation. But NOT lo-fi hip-hop with trap drums. Not beats-to-study-to. The LoFi here is about warmth and analog character, not about a specific drum pattern or genre formula.

### What I Do NOT Want

- Generic lo-fi hip-hop / beats-to-study-to producers
- Ambient drone or dark ambient composers
- Chiptune or retro game music (despite the project having pixel art visuals)
- Celtic or medieval pastiche
- EDM, house, synthwave, or anything with a driving beat
- New age / spa / meditation music
- AI-generated music producers
- Composers who primarily work from sample packs and loop libraries rather than original composition

### Reference Points (Not to Copy, But to Triangulate)

Help me find composers whose work lives in the intersection of artists like these:

- **Lofi Girl channel** — for the ambient productivity function, but with more soul and fantasy texture
- **Jeremy Soule** (Elder Scrolls soundtracks) — for the fantasy atmosphere and emotional weight, but stripped down to intimate instrumentation
- **Adriel Favela / Nettlebed** / indie LoFi artists who use real instruments — for the organic, handmade quality
- **Phoebe Bridgers / Bon Iver** — not sonically, but for the feeling of intimacy and melancholy-without-sadness
- **Tavern ambiance creators** (D&D/TTRPG space) — for the fantasy setting energy, but composed as actual music, not soundscapes

### What I Need You to Research

1. **Specific composers and producers** — Find individuals (not agencies) who have existing portfolios that overlap with at least two of my three pillars (fantasy-adjacent, productivity, LoFi). Search across:
   - Bandcamp (artists tagged with relevant combinations)
   - Spotify (artists on fantasy LoFi, tavern music, study music, or ambient fantasy playlists)
   - YouTube (channels producing original fantasy-adjacent LoFi or tavern/inn ambiance music)
   - Fiverr and Upwork (mid-tier composers with relevant portfolios, not bulk beat makers)
   - SoundCloud (independent producers in this niche)
   - Reddit communities (r/composer, r/LofiHipHop, r/gamemusic, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers)
   - TTRPG / D&D music communities (composers making tavern and inn ambiance)

2. **For each composer you find, tell me:**
   - Name / artist name
   - Where to find their work (links)
   - What makes them a fit (which of the three pillars they hit)
   - What might be a gap (which pillar they might miss)
   - Estimated rate tier if available (budget, mid-tier, or premium)
   - Whether they appear to do freelance/commission work

3. **Adjacent niches to mine** — Identify subgenres, playlists, communities, or scenes where my kind of composer is likely already working, even if they don't call their work "fantasy LoFi." Examples might include:
   - Indie game soundtrack composers who lean ambient
   - TTRPG ambiance creators who also compose original music
   - Acoustic/folk artists who produce lo-fi textured instrumentals
   - Film scoring students or early-career film composers
   - Worship music or contemplative music producers (for the warmth and organic instrumentation)

4. **Platforms and communities where I should post listings** — Where do composers in this niche look for work? Not just Fiverr and Upwork, but niche job boards, Discord servers, subreddits, Facebook groups, and composer communities.

5. **Search terms and tags** — Give me the specific keywords, hashtags, Bandcamp tags, and Spotify search terms that will surface this kind of music so I can do my own digging.

### About the Project (For Context)

Outside Inn is a real business — LLC formed, trademarks filed, launch date set for March 3, 2026. The radio station broadcasts 24/7 across YouTube, Kick, Rumble, and Facebook with a pixel art animation of a character writing at a desk inside a stone inn. The brand concept is "the place between places" — every element lives in the liminal space between two opposites (Day/Night = Dusk, Home/Destination = Inn, etc.). The 14 album tracks are each named for a threshold concept.

This is a work-for-hire contract. The composer delivers original music, gets paid a per-track or per-minute fee, and I retain 100% of masters and publishing. No revenue sharing, no backend. The tradeoff is a fair upfront rate and creative credit (composers receive an in-world title and are credited on all releases).

I'm looking for hungry, talented mid-tier composers — people with real skill and real portfolios who haven't yet priced themselves into the $500+/minute range. People who would be excited to build a catalog for a fantasy radio station, not people looking for their next film score.

**Start the research. Be thorough. Prioritize quality of fit over quantity of names.**
