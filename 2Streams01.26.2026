## The Two Streams

### Outside Inn (24/7 Radio Station)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tagline** | "Step inn anytime, and stay." |
| **Format** | Continuous LoFi fantasy radio broadcast |
| **Visual** | Looping animation of Holdt (steampunk Holden Caulfield) writing |
| **Audio** | 99-minute seamless LoFi loop by Carson Thatcher |
| **Platforms** | YouTube, Twitch, Kick, Facebook LIVE, Rumble (5 simultaneous) |

The Inn is always open. Music never stops. This is the default broadcast state.

### E.I. Werner (Gaming Stream)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Flagship host of Outside Inn |
| **Format** | Scheduled gaming streams hosted by the Inn |
| **Music** | Innspired LoFi plays at 50% volume during gameplay |
| **Purpose** | Testing ground for OI stream technologies before full deployment |
| **Content** | Strategy games (Anno, Civilization), variety gaming, WoW lore series |

When EIW goes live, the Inn hosts his stream. Radio listeners discover the host; gaming viewers discover the Inn.

#### WoW Lore Series Concept

Custom narrative tying Outside Inn to World of Warcraft's Goldshire history. Features Deadkeep, a Dark Iron Dwarf Death Knight, uncovering the lost history of the original Outside Inn through the Archaeology profession.

### Broadcast Modes

| Mode | Visual | Audio |
|------|--------|-------|
| Radio Mode | Holdt animation loop, no host | Innspired LoFi at 100% volume |
| Live Mode | E.I. Werner gaming, hosted by Inn | Innspired LoFi at 50% volume |

## Brand Relationship

Outside Inn and E.I. Werner are distinct but complementary brands that must retain continuity.

### Shared Elements

- Alagard font consistency across all assets
- Cross-promotion and reposting between brands
- Innspired LoFi music plays on both streams
- EIW stream serves as tech testing ground for OI

### E.I. Werner Brand Voice

The charismatic barkeep you came to the Inn to see. Warm, confident, literate—a true geek with sophisticated tastes. Not a performer; a host. The energy is cozy but intentional: like stepping into a room where someone's been working quietly, and they're grateful you arrived.

> *"It can't take itself too seriously, but it also can't be purely playful—there's real craft and ambition underneath. The tension between those two things is the brand."*

### Brand Philosophy: The Threshold Between

The Outside Inn is built on the concept of boundaries and the liminal space between them. Every element explores this quality.

| Inside | Outside | Between (Where We Live) |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Home | Destination | **Inn** |
| Indoors | Outdoors | **Window** |
| Artifact | Machine | **Artifice** |
| History | Fantasy | **Myth** |
| Mortal | Divine | **Legend** |
| Day | Night | **Dusk** |
| Past | Present | **Memory** |
| Present | Future | **Dream** |
| Welcome | Unwelcome | **Invitation** |
| Joy | Danger | **Precipice** |
