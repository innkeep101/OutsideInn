# The Outside Inn — Hardware Stack

## Project Goal

The Outside Inn operates two concurrent broadcast channels:

1. **24/7 LoFi Radio Stream** — A continuous animated stream featuring Holdt (a steampunk Holden Caulfield) writing at a desk, with original music by Carson Thatcher looping over the animation by Marwan Hasnaoui.

2. **Gaming Livestreams** — Scheduled variety gaming streams hosted by E.I. Werner, with the LoFi radio music playing at reduced volume in the background.

Both channels simulcast across **YouTube, Twitch, Kick, Facebook, and Rumble** from a nomadic setup in Costa Rica.
