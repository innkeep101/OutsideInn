# The Outside Inn — Hardware Stack

**Broadcast Infrastructure** | Last Updated: December 2, 2025

## Project Goal

The Outside Inn operates a single 24/7 broadcast with two modes:

1. **Radio Mode** — A continuous animated stream featuring Holdt (a steampunk Holden Caulfield) writing at a desk, with original music by Carson Thatcher looping over the animation by Marwan Hasnaoui. Music at 100% volume.

2. **Live Mode** — When E.I. Werner goes live, the Inn hosts his stream. Carson's music continues at 50% volume behind gameplay. Audiences mix—radio listeners discover the host, gaming viewers discover the Inn.

Both modes simulcast across **YouTube, Twitch, Kick, Facebook, and Rumble** from a nomadic setup in Costa Rica.
